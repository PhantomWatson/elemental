                    In June, 2016 this article was cited by the American College Health Association in their updated guidelines for colleges and universities on sexual assault prevention. In prior guidelines the Association had stressed only primary prevention, but our work on the importance of combining primary prevention with risk reduction spurred the Association to change its position and recommend that both approaches be used in prevention efforts. This is a major policy change that has resulted, at least in part, from our research. The guidelines can be found at: <a href="http://www.acha.org/documents/resources/guidelines/Addressing_Sexual_Violence.pdf">http://www.acha.org/documents/resources/guidelines/Addressing_Sexual_Violence.pdf</a>
